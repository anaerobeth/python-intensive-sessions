Quiz: 
Print the sum of the digits in the integer 13950. Find its largest digit.

Part E. Chapter 5 Conditionals and recursion

1. Which of the ff. will return True?
a. 5 == 6
b. 6%2 >= 0
c. 12%2 == 0 or 12%3 == 0
d. 42 and False
e. 105 // 60 == 1

2. Why is it generally okay to use chained conditionals but nested conditionals are to be avoided if possible?

3. Write a recursive program to print the ff:
*****
****
***
**
*
Blastoff!

4. Optional: Solve Chapter 5 Exercise 1. (Homework: Solve Exercise 2)


Part F. Chapter 6 Fruitful functions

1. What is special about the Python keyword 'return'?

2. Write a function absolute_value() that correctly handles the ff. inputs: 1, 5, -10, 0, 4.2, 'bananas'.

3. Why is preferable to practice scaffolding and incremental development over working on big chunks of code?

4. Write a function is_between(x, y, z) that returns True if x ≤ y ≤ z or False otherwise. 


5. Write a function factorial() that computes the factorial of positive integers. (Challenge problem: Write another function is_digit_factorial() that checks if a number is equal to the sum of the factorial of their digits. For example: 145 is a digit factorial because 1! + 4! + 5! = 1 + 24 + 120 = 145. )



Part G. Chapter 7 Iteration

1. Which of the ff. code will return an error? How would you fix it?
a. x = x + 1 
b. 5 ** 24
c. y -= y
d. z *= z

2. Write a function liftoff() that uses a while loop to print the ff:
*
**
***
****
*****
Liftoff!

3. Homework: Solve Chapter 7 Exercise 1.


Part H. Chapter 8 Strings

1. Given: fruit = 'banana', print the ff.:
a. 'ban'
b. 'anana'
c. 'ananab'
d. 'banban'
e. 'bbabanbanabananbanana'
f. 'b4n4n4'
g. 'Banana'
h. 'banana danana panana tanana'
i. 'bnn'
j. ['b', 'a', 'n', 'a', 'n', 'a']
k. 'BANANAS' 
j. b=1 a=3 n=2

2. Write a function named count() based on the loop in Ex. 8.7 and generalize it so that it can accept any word and any letter. (Challenge problem: Count the number of i's in "Mississippi".)
