Part A. 

1. Sign up for a Github account. 

2. Install Jupyter notebook and launch it. Create a new folder called 'Python Intensive - Week 1'. Save your solutions to the following exercises in separate python notebooks (ex. part-b-solutions.ipynb, etc.) 


Part B. Chapter 1 The way of the program 

1. Print 'Hello world"

2. Print the types of the ff:
a. 2 
b. 42.0 
c. 'Data Science'
d. True
e. None

3. What are the two types of syntax rules?

4. Use Python to solve this: If you run a 10 kilometer race in 42 minutes 42 seconds, what is your average pace (time per mile in minutes and seconds)? What is your average speed in miles per hour?


Part C. Chapter 2 Variables, expressions and statements

1. How is running Python in script mode different from interactive mode?

2. Save the string 'spam' as a variable and print it 3 times without spaces in between. Also print the result as 'SPAMSPAMSPAM', 'SpamSpamSpam' and 'spam spam spam')

3. Apply your knowledge of variables and operations to answer this: Suppose the cover price of a book is $24.95, but bookstores get a 40% discount. Shipping costs $3 for the first copy and 75 cents for each additional copy. What is the total wholesale cost for 60 copies? 

Part D. Chapter 3 Functions

1. Why will each of the ff. code return an error?
a. int('Hello') 
b. hours * 60 = 15 
c. float('apple')
d. math.sqrt(2) / 2.0

2. What is the difference between local and global variables?

3. Why is debugging code like detective work?

4. Create functions to print the lyrics of the song 'With or without you' (http://www.metrolyric...Â­)


Part E. Chapter 5 Conditionals and recursion

1. Which of the ff. will return True?
a. 5 == 6
b. 6%2 >= 0
c. 12%2 == 0 or 12%3 == 0
d. 42 and False
e. 105 // 60 == 1

2. Why is it generally okay to use chained conditionals but nested conditionals are to be avoided if possible?

3. Write a recursive program to print the ff:
*****
****
***
**
*
Blastoff!

4. Solve Exercise 1. (Homework: Solve Exercise 2)
Small update to the event: conference room is moved from 3rd floor Credenza TO --> 7th Floor "Wingback"
